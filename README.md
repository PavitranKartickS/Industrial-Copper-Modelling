# Guvi Capstone Project 5: Industrial-Copper-Modelling

## Introduction:
This Industrial Copper Modelling project mainly focuses on the process of price prediction and status prediction of provided data points of copper based on the data provided along with the problem statement.By exploring the dataset, applying appropriate pre processing techniques we have been able to create the data suitable for machine learning training process.The models will utilize advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection and handling, handling data in the wrong format, and leveraging tree-based models, specifically the decision tree algorithm, to predict the selling price and leads accurately.

## Project Takeaway:
The main takeaways from this project are as follows:

- Exploring Skewness and Outliers: Analyze the distribution of variables in the dataset and identify skewness and outliers. This step helps in understanding the data quality and potential issues that may affect the model performance.

- Data Transformation and Cleaning: Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis and perform necessary cleaning steps. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

- Machine Learning Regression Algorithms: Apply various machine learning regression algorithms to predict the selling price of industrial copper. Compare the performance of algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.

- Machine Learning Classification Algorithms: Apply different machine learning classification algorithms to predict the status (won or lost) of copper transactions. Explore algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or random forests to classify the outcomes.

- Evaluation and Model Selection: Evaluate the performance of regression and classification models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), accuracy, precision, and recall. Select the best-performing models based on these metrics.
